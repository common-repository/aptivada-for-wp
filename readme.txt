**Easily add contests/promotions to your WordPress site using our plugin**

== Description ==
Login to your Audience Admin account to get your contest/promotion created. Choose one of our professionally designed templates (or start from scratch) and customize it to your liking. Audience’s plugin provides a shortcode to easily place your contest anywhere you like. When your contest or promotion is up and running, Audience will store all entry data: email addresses, photos, videos, votes and more. You can export your data at any time to use for future marketing efforts. Audience also provides in-depth analytics to help you understand where your "audience" is coming from.

Don’t have a Audience Admin account yet? Head to [Audience.io](https://www.audience.io) and request a demo.
